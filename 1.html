  <p style="margin-top:30px">The 11 players are allocated
    different positions that help the
    game to be played tactically. Beginning
    with the <strong>goalkeeper</strong> who can use hands to block
    an incoming ball to the goal post, there are the
    <strong>defenders</strong>, <strong>midfielders</strong>, and the <strong>strikers</strong>.
