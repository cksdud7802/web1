  <h2>Different positions in football</h2>

<p>Besides the goalkeeper, the positions are divided into 4 general categories:
  the defender, midfielder, and the striker.</p>

<h2><strong>Defender</strong></h2>

<p>Defenders play behind the midfielders and their primary responsibility is to
  provide support to the team and to prevent the opposition from scoring a goal
  .They usually remain in the half of the field that contains the goal they are
  defending. Taller defenders will move forward to the opposing team's penalty box
  when their team takes corner kicks or free kicks, where scoring with one's head
  is a possibility.</p>

<h2><strong>Midfielder</strong></h2>

<p>A midfielder plays between the defence and attack. Midfielders (originally called half-backs)
are players whose position of play is midway between the attacking forwards and the defenders.
Their main duties are to maintain possession of the ball, taking the ball from defenders and
feeding it to the strikers, as well as dispossessing opposing players.</p>

<h2><strong>Striker</strong></h2>

<p>The striker (wearing the red shirt) is past the defence (in the white shirts) and is about to take a shot at the goal.
Forwards (or strikers) are the players who are positioned nearest to the opposing team's goal. The primary responsibility of forwards is to score goals and to create scoring chances for other players. Forwards may also contribute defensively by harrying opposition defenders and goalkeepers whilst not in possession.</p>
